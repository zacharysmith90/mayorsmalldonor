          <p>As the 2021 race for New York City mayor picks up, small-donor contributions reveal which candidates are focusing on a grassroots movement, and by extension, the voice of the everyday voter. </p>
          <p>This election comes off a federal election that was largely funded by small donations, a fact boasted by candidates primarily funded by small donors. In New York City, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez began 2020 with more than 75%
            of her campaign contributions from small donors, reported The Center of Responsive Politics.</p>
          <p> "It's become a status symbol for those running for elected office, that the more small donations you get, the more involved an electorate you have," said former New York State Assemblyman Keith L.T. Wright, current Chair of the New York
            County
            Democratic Committee.</p>

                  if (void 0 !== a.data["datawrapper-height"])
                    for (var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]) {
                      var t = document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-" + e) || document.querySelector("iframe[src*='" + e + "']");
                      t && (t.style.height = a.data["datawrapper-height"][e] + "px")
                    }
                }))
              }();
            </script>
          </div>

          <p> Campaign contributions reported in July to the New York City Campaign Finance Board show which candidates have solicited the most support from small donors so far.</p>
          <p> Front runners and New York City political mainstays Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams and New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer lead in contributions from small donors. However, small donors are also supporting political outsider
            Dianne Morales, a former CEO of multiple non-profits organizations.</p>
          <p> Morales is nearly tied with Stringer for individual small-donor support, with an average donation of $37. Stinger and Adams's small donor contributions average $60 and $82, respectively. </p>
          <p> The board tracks campaign contributions as part of its voluntary public matching funds program, which matches $8 to every $1 contributed from a donor, with a cap at $250 for the mayoral race. The financial boost helps candidates rely on
            small donations to fund their campaigns, which the board defines as $175. </p>
          <p> Candidates must disclose funds to the board twice a year until the election year. In 2021, candidates will have to report their fundraising more frequently, ranging from quarterly to daily reports. </p>

          <p>The last time New York City elected a new mayor was in 2013. At this same point in the mayoral race, candidate Christine Quinn was in the lead for campaign contributions, while then-candidate Bill de Blasio was fourth. All of the top
            candidates had more large donors than small, and the smallest average small donation for any candidate was $76.</p>
          <p> If small donors are representative of an involved electorate and a candidate's commitment to their constituency, the next mayor of New York City may have more citywide support than has been seen in nearly a decade. </p>
